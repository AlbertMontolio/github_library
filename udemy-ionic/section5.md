# 98. Lists & Performance Issues

When using lists in your application, you can hit performance issues - especially if those lists are very long and complex.

Typically, such lists are not rendered as whole but only in fragments - only the part currently shown on the screen. In web apps (and therefore in your Angular app), this does not work like this - lists are loaded as whole (unless you implement you own lazy-loading mechanism).

Ionic 2 offers a special directive you may use to fix potential performance issues => VirtualScroll.

On a basic list, you use it like this:

```
<ion-list [virtualScroll]="items">
    <ion-item *virtualItem="let item">
        {â€Œ{ item }}
    </ion-item>
</ion-list>
```

This will ensure, that only the visible part of the screen gets rendered. Dive into the above article to learn more about this functionality.
