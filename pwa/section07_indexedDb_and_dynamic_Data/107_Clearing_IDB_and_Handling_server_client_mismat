107_Clearing_IDB_and_Handling_server_client_mismatch.md

lets add a second post in firebase

if we do changes in our db, no problem

but if we remove the second post

the second post is still in the cache!

put overwrites, but if it does not have it, it does not do anything

in sw.js

we can clear the entire db, before we writeData

lets implement the clear method
