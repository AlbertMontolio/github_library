151_connecting_server_client_pwa.md

in the last lecture, we created a subscription stored in the server


the subscription always refers to a device

to a given sw worker there also

if we go to our client side application, clear site data, we delete sw and subscription

but not in the server

so subs in the server wont work

if you unregister sw, you fuck up your subs

dont unregister, just update your sw
