- CSS gives the style of the page, the colors, the forms, the positining of the elements.
- JavaScript is a programming language, that allows you to put some dynamism in your page. Elements that move while scrolling, effects while clicking the buttons etc.

More over, you have two important libraries that helps you with the style of your page. These libraries are Bootstrap from Twitter and Material Design from Google. If you use them, you don't need to write lines of design, because you can import a lot of elements from them, like navbars, buttons, drop downs etc.

If you want to host your page, so that people can see it, you should definitely check out these services: Github Pages and Heroku. If your page is an easy one, a static one, without a server-part, you can use Github Pages. They host your webpage for free. On the other hand, if you are building a web application, with some logic, you can use Heroku.
