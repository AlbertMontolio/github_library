# Acquisition

How do peole know I exist? 

## Social media

First of all, you need to have a strong presence in social media. It's not optional, it's a mass. Facebook is not a social network. It's the biggest adverticement agency in the world.

Which social network, will depend on your audience. If you are more picture-oriented (mode, travel, etc.) you may focus on Instagram. If you are more events-oriented, you may focus on Facebook. If you are more knowledge-oriented (education, books, etc.) you may focus on Twitter.
Since we are speaking about Startups, let's not forget that we don't have endless resources and money, so focus just in one, the one that works best for you and don't try to cover all of them poorly.

## Workshops / Content

Nowadays it's key to offer something to the customer before they purchase your product or service. Think about the amount of services that are out there for free. There are millions of Youtube videos teaching you something, millions of websites where you can log in and start using the service without paying anything.

If you want people to know you, you have to be present in their lifes, they have to see you, and most important, the content that you supply, must be amazing.

## Medium (blogging portal) 
Medium is an amazing place to start. You not only can explain what your product is about, but also you have some audience by default just by being at Medium.

## Meetups
Organizing Meetups is also a very good strategy. You can organize workshops, where you give some skills to the people. If they are happy with your information, more important, if they are happy on how you give this information, they will come back to you for more.

## Newsletters
Newsletters are also a very strong way of acquiring clients, if the content that you give is powerful. Take the position of the customer for one second: they receive an email, with valuable information. They don't need to attend a workshop, they don't need to go to a website. They just click the email, and they can learn something. If you achieve to have a big list of emails and subscribers are happy, you have a lot of potential clients.

## Paid ads

Say that you already have a list of emails from potential customers, but it's not enough. You can upload this list to Facebook Ads, for example, pay, and they will reach people with similar interests etc. So you will reach people who may end up being customers.

Same works for Google AdWords. You can pay to positionate your website better in the Google Search Engine, you pay for every click.

Do not forget, that paying for clicks, visits is not the key. The key is, how many visitors purchase your product service. The conversion. Be careful of paying a lot of money for paid ads, if customers are not buying your product. Customers are not stupid. Just because you appear on their screen, that won't make them pay. They might click, but you have to convince them.
