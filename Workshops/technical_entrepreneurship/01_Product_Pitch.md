# Product Pitch

Once you have your idea, you have to be able to explain it the best way. You can not hesitate in front of potential investors, customers or friends. You should be able to explain your product in one sentence, the so called Value Proposition.

It may look easy, because it's our idea, and we think that we know what to explain. But you should ask people if they really understand your point, and moreover, if they are interested in.

To help you with that, you can follow this pattern:

- Target: Who are my customers?
- Pain: What do they suffer from?
- Solution: How do I answer their need?

## Target

The more specific is your target, the better. If you are too broad, you may end up compiting with bigger clients. Say you want to build a social network. You have to compete against Facebook, Instagram etc. It will be tough. You have to find a market niche, a small sector of the population with a very specific demand. If you cover their needs, you will be successful, and only then, you can think about expanding to other sectors or other markets. 

## Pain

If you want to convince a client, you can not tell him, that you may improve a little bit his life. We don't spend time and money for minor changes. You have to find his pain, that way, you will find a strong connection with him, a strong empathy.

## Solution

Once you know who are your target and what is their pain, you have to bring your solution, your product or your service. It must specifically solve the pain. Don't try to offer many solutions, try to focus in one particular thing, but excelling on it.

# Example: Airbnb vs. Booking

Let's compare the product pitch of Airbnb and Booking. Both of them are meant to book a stay right?

Airbnb:

- target: travelers with budget. They don't mind paying a little bit more if the experience is awesome
- pain: travelers that travel and they don't get the local experience. They want to avoid going to a place, doing the touristic stuff and going home. They miss the experience
- solution: stay with the locals. While staying in local houses, travelers can get the local experience, get to know the people, the food, etc.

Booking:

- target: travelers with no budget, who spend time looking for the best offers.
- pain: traveling is expensive, hotels are expensive. Not everyone can travel.
- solution: a website where you can find all the possible hotels, hostals, with a lot of filters, so you can find the perfect and cheapest stay for you. It's not about the beauty of the website, of the experience, but about getting the best deal, through as much information as possible.
