# Scale

At some point, your startup is so successful that you need to scale. You can not rely on so many external services. You have to create some of them by yourself. You have two options: wheather you learn to programm, and you build it your way or you hire a CTO (Chief Technology Officer).

It's time to user more powerful servers, time to have a more robust web application, a better user experience etc.
