# UTM-ize your URL (add keywords to your webpage adress).

Say that you are paying a community manager to run some campaigns on Twitter. User click the shared links to go to your website. How do you know which campaigns were working the most?

You put some keywords in the links that the community manager shares. As an example, you can put the name of the Twitter campaign that you are running:
www.myawesome.page?campaign=twitter_campaign_august_2017

This way, whenever you analyze your traffic in Google Analytics (or in another tool), these tools are intelligent enough to understand these keywords, and differentiate which visitors are coming from this special address and which ones don't.

How to add this worlds? You just need to google in Google: UTM Google and you will find the service Campaign URL Builder.
