# Activation

What do I want people to do?

Once you acquire the customers, you have their emails, their contacts, it's time to make them do what you want. It can be buying your product, but it also can be signing up to your webpage, or coming to a workshop event.

If you go to the websites of big companies, you will find clearly in the main page, what they want you to do. Go to Twitter. You will not find a huge website. Actually, the new website is just a screen: Sign up. Why the want you to sign up? Because their model is to build volume of information, of users.

If you have a company who are selling spanish products, you don't want them to sign up to your page. You want clients to buy your product. The activation is the purchase. Put a nice big button for that.
