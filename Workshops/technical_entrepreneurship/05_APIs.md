# APIs

Most of the services that we mentioned (payment system, log in forms etc.) they work through the so called APIs.

Before understanding what an API is, let's understand how internet works.

We are in the browser, as a client, typing www.facebook.com. When we press enter, we send a request to a Facebook server. We are asking to see this page. We are making a request.

This request comes to a Facebook server and is being processed. Sometimes we want to see the webpage, sometimes we want to post something etc. Once the server has done what he has to do, for example, if you want to post something in Facebook, the server would store your post in the Facebook data base. Once this action is done, the server gives you back a response. It gives you back a webpage. If you ask for the page www.facebook.com, the server gives you back a blue page with some pictures of your friends.

This response that you get back from the server, this website that you get back, is a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. We learnt this languages in a previous section.

Well, APIs work the same way. You ask them for something, and they give you back something. The difference is, instead of giving you nice pictures with nice colors, they give you back raw text. 

APIs is the vehicle on how computers, websites communicate between them. Your webpage, when it uses a Payment System, uses an API from this company. It sends the payment data through an API, not through pictures.

Think about APIs as plain boring text, that computers understand, to ask and give information.

If you want to see with your own eyes, type these two directions in your browser:

- https://github.com/albertmontolio

- https://api.github.com/users/albertmontolio

In one direction, you will see my profile in a coding social network. In the other one, you are calling an API, you get back just text.

Nowadays, you need to use APIs to build your webpage, web application or product. You can not develop everything by yourself. You need to take advantage of APIs. You just need to learn how to integrate them.
