# Prototyping

Before you start building your webpage or product, it's key to prototype it. That means, to sketch it, to design it before you start the action.

There are three main stages: low fidelity, medium fidelity and high fidelity.

Low fidelity means that you just sketch your page, with rough lines. It's about brain storming. Medium Fidelity it's about designing your page with the components (navbars, pictures etc.), also briefly, but you can already see more or less your webpage or product. High fidelity means that you almost design the 100% of your page.

Why is this important? This step can save you hours of development, since everything is decided in this early stage. If you avoid this step, while you are building your product, you will face a lot of discussions about design, about buttons, that you could have avoid, if you had done a good prototyping.

There are two main softwares on the market to design your product or service: sketch.com and figma.com.
