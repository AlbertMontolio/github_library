# Slack: where work happens

Once your webpage is working, you are getting traffic and your services are working, it's time to work as a boss and manage all of this information.

The best way to do that, in Startups, is Slack. Slack is a sort of chat, Skype, Whatsapp, file sharing etc. You can organize your team in channels, notify every team member, send files etc.

The best part is, that you can integrate also other API services. For example, whenever you get an email from a new customer through Wuffo or another external service, it can be sent directly to one of your Slack channels.
