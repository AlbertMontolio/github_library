# Zapier: connect all your services
Once you integrate all these services to your webpage, you can connect them all. A specific example: say that you are getting a lot of emails through Wuffo (the services to embed user forms in your webpage). You end up with a huge list of emails. Say that, for whatever reasons, you want to have this list of emails in Trello (Trello allows you to organize your tasks with sort of cards).

With Zapier, you can tell that, whenever you receive an email at Wuffo, it should be automatically sent to Trello. This way, you can manage the emails in Trello.

There are a lot of ways of using Zapier, you can conect email lists to Google Sheets, to Twitter, to Facebook etc.
