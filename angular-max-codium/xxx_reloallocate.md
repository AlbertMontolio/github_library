Just to get started it, depending on the CLI version you're using, you might also need to add the `FormsModule`  to the `imports[]`  array in your `app.module.ts`  file (add it if you don't see it there). You might not fully understand what that all means but we're going to cover that in this course, no worries.

If you don't have FormsModule  in imports[]  in AppModule , please do add it and also add an import at the top of that file:

```js
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
```
