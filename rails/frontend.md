CSRF token, i can see it in the browser!

rails var to js using webpack

we can not pass variables from the view to the code anymore

we have 3 options

1. Either keep them in DOM as data-* attributed, read it using js
2. Load them using API as json using event handles
3. Use GON as the SO link

first one is awesome!

then JSON.parse etc.

becareful with the token, if you are using fetch

you need to access it
